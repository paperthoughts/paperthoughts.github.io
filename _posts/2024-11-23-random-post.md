## A Random Post I've Found

i jumped on twitter for a moment and found this lil tidbit. i hope it posts before the clock ticks over

we slept together, <br>
showered skin to skin, <br>
created soul ties, <br>
said i love you, <br>
kissed with morning breath, <br>
talked about our past,<br>
present, future, <br>
our dreams,<br>
cried in each others arms, <br>
so no i can not thug this out...

thought it was kinda funny given the current situation
