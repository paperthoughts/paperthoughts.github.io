## A Random Post I've Found

i jumped on twitter for a moment and found this lil tidbit. i hope it posts before the clock ticks over

we slept together, <br>
showered skin to skin, <br>
created soul ties,
said i love you, 
kissed with morning breath,
talked about our past,
present, future, 
our dreams,
cried in each others arms, 
so no i can not thug this out...

thought it was kinda funny given the current situation
