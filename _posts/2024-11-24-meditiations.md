## meditations

I find it peculiar how, throughout scripture, when a man longs to throw himself into the pits of hell; whenever a man attempts to take his own life; he has met with the Lord's grace, and there he finds his refuge  his peace, and his comfort. 

This is the third time in my life where the Lord has saved me. 

Much Love, Yours Truly
