I know, three posts already. However, there is a very loud car alarm blaring through the culdesac, which is being quite ridiculous.

Nonetheless, I've been left thinking about Christmas. Until 2022, I didn't really look forward to Christmas. But, in 2022, I found a girl who changed that for me.fted me a keychain. A lego keychain with our initials. This small gift meant the whole world to me; a girl thought that I was good-looking (or just funny) enough to go out of her way for me. That made Christmas very special for me.

Come to 2023. and I'm still with this girl at Christmas time. Unfortunately, due to severely horrible circumstance prior, we could not spend this together. It was truly heart breaking for me. The plan was that I would spend it with her and her family, and it was all tossed asunder. Nonetheless, we managed to meet up and spend time with one another, and it is those moment which I cherish so dearly. for they preserve my child-like desire for a beautiful Christmas.

This year, however, things are markedly different. I'm approaching Christmas and am newly single. I have no (secular) reason to be to excited for it. Of course, I am delighted to celebrate the birth of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, but there will be, likely, no time spent or gifts exchanged with this lovely girl. This is, of course, entirely my fault; for I had broken up with her. Yet, as the realisation of the severity of my actions are settling, so too is the realisation that, ultimately, I have nobody to look forward to Christmas with. This would be our first, full, exciting Christmas together, and now, it is yet another day in the calendar. And, I find this deeply upsetting. What was once a source of Joy remains to be so in a spiritually nourishing sense, but on an emotinal level, Christmas is coming to be a source of tears and sorrow. Alas, this is what I deserve; the consequences of my actions.

Much Love, Yours Truly
