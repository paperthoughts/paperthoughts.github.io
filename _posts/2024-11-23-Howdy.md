I understand that you need space to think. In the meantime, should you wish to know how I am going, this here shall be my little outlet for my thoughts. I'm praying for you. Look after yourself, but please, don't assume that us is impossible, or that you have to get away from me. That's not necessarily healing. 

Much Love,
Yours Truly
