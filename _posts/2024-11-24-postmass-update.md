## After Mass, Before Work

So, I've just gotten home from Mass, which was lovely. I was feeling quite sad, because I would've liked to have explored the service with you, but it's really alright. I'm about to do some reading, but I am still feeling a bit sombre.

Nonetheless, I just want to let you know that I love you, I'm here for oyu, and I really hope that you're doing well and processing well. ALSO, since the break-up, I've been tracking my like health with some metrics, so I might keep you up-to-date with summaries of each day as I go. Just in case :)

Much Love, Yours Truly
