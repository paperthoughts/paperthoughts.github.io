## Howdy

I understand that you need space to think. In the meantime, should you wish to know how I am going, this here shall be my little outlet for my thoughts. I'm praying for you. Look after yourself, but please, don't assume that us is impossible, or that you have to get away from me. That's not necessarily healing. 

Paige, I do foresee a future where everything turns out alright for us. I know it's too late for me to decide, but it really is up to you now. I will support whatever decision you make, even if you decide against that future of ours.

Much Love,
Yours Truly
