## A Confession

So, I donâ€™t know if you'll read this, but I want to apologise for everything. And, I can't do that here because it has to be in person. But, as a little taster I guess, I'm not becoming Catholic. If you read this and care to hear more, feel free reach out to me Paige.

Much Love, Yours Truly
